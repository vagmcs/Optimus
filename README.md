Optimus is a library for Linear and Quadratic mathematical optimization written in [Scala programming language](http://scala-lang.org).

## Features

1. High level mathematical modeling in Scala using algebraic expressions
  * Linear and quadratic objective and constraint expressions.
  * Higher order expressions cannot be defined or handled by the solvers yet.
  * Addition, subtraction and multiplication operations can be performed on expressions.
  * Expression simplification produces the simpler form of the expression.
2. Supports various optimization settings by using existing mathematical programming solvers
  * Linear programming (LP)
  * Quadratic programming (QP)
  * Quadratic constraint quadratic programming (QCQP)
  * Mixed integer programming (MIP)
3. Available solvers:
  * Open source [LpSolve](http://sourceforge.net/projects/lpsolve/) can be used for LP and MIP.
  * Open source [oJSolver](http://ojalgo.org/) can be used for LP, QP and MIP.
  * Proprietary solver [Gurobi 12](http://www.gurobi.com/) can be used for efficiently solving LP, QP, QCQP and MIP.
  * Proprietary solver [Mosek 9](https://www.mosek.com/) can be used for efficiently solving LP, QP, QCQP and MIP.

## How to get Optimus

Optimus is published to Maven Central for Scala 2.12, 2.13 and 3.3.4! 

Add the following dependencies to your SBT build file in order to get started:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
    "com.github.vagmcs" %% "optimus" % "3.4.5",
    "com.github.vagmcs" %% "optimus-solver-oj" % "3.4.5",
    "com.github.vagmcs" %% "optimus-solver-lp" % "3.4.5"
)
```

Optionally, you can also add the following extra dependencies for proprietary solvers:

```scala
"com.github.vagmcs" %% "optimus-solver-gurobi" % "3.4.5"
"com.github.vagmcs" %% "optimus-solver-mosek" % "3.4.5"
```
